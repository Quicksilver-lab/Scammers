# Victim Statement: Mumtaz B. B.

## Victim Statement

**Name:** Mukarram Aziz

**Date of Incident:** 17/July/2024

**Description of Incident:**

I received an SMS from a number claiming to be from the Benazir Support Program. The message stated that I had won a significant prize and needed to contact a representative named Roshan Ali Lakri for further details. The message looked legitimate and mentioned a large amount of money that I supposedly won.

Upon contacting the provided number, Roshan Ali Lakri asked for my personal information, including my CNIC number and mobile payment details (EasyPaisa or JazzCash). He said this information was necessary to process the prize. He also asked for a small fee to cover administrative costs, which seemed reasonable at the time.

After providing the requested information and making the payment, I received no further communication. My attempts to reach out were met with silence, and I soon realized that I had been scammed.

**Impact:**

This incident caused me significant financial loss and emotional distress. I felt violated and deceived, knowing that my personal information had been misused and that my hard-earned money was gone.

## Statement of Cooperation

I am willing to cooperate with law enforcement authorities and provide any additional information required to help bring Mumtaz B. B. and her accomplices to justice. I hope that by sharing my experience, I can prevent others from falling victim to similar scams.
